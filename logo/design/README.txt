Your PRINT file

If you want your logo to be printed on business cards, flyers, clothes, etc. send a PDF or SVG version of your logo to the printer. If the impression is more technical and needs modifications on the printer, send the vector file (SVG). The files provided are of a size of 5000 px (the vector file use is recommended for top quality printing results).

Your WEB file

The provided files are suitable for web use: website, blogs, social media profile pictures, emails, etc.
These files come in three sizes: 200 px, 500 px, and 1000 px.

Here are some tips on how you can use your logo:

What is the purpose of a vector file (SVG & PDF)?

Vector files are very useful because they can be resized to any size without compromising on the quality.

You might have seen JPG files with blurred borders and of poor quality. A vector file never deals with that. Vector files are mathematically calculated to adapt perfectly to all size. Vector files are commonly used for printing.  

Do you want to send your logo to a designer?

If you want to send your logo to a designer or a graphic artist to make some changes, use SVG files unless otherwise stated.  

Do you want to share your logo?

When you share your logo, send a PDF or a PNG file preferably because these file formats are easy to read. 

If you have any questions about your logo, feel free to contact our customer service by email at support@freelogodesign.org.
