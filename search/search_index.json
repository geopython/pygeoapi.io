Only existing PSC members may vote on new members. Nominees must receive a majority vote from existing members to be added to the PSC. Stepping Down If for some reason a PSC member is not able to fully participate then they are free to step down. If a member is not active for a period of 12 months then the committee reserves the right to seek nominations to fill that position. PSC members who have stepped down or have been replaced as certainly welcome to return upon nomincation. Membership Responsibilities Guiding Development Members should take an active role guiding the development of new features they feel passionate about. Once a change request has been accepted and given the go ahead to proceed does not mean the members are free of their obligation. PSC members voting +1 for a change request are expected to stay engaged and ensure the change is implemented and documented in a way that is most beneficial to users. Note that this applies not only to change requests that affect code, but also those that affect the website, technical infrastructure, policies and standards.

Background Having started in 2018 , a core goal of pygeoapi was to develop and provide an OGC API server that is light on core dependencies. Since then, the project has experienced considerable success in the number of features implemented and standards supported. A reality of the aforementioned has been the addition of numerous dependencies that have impacted the codebase on various operating systems and environments. pygeoapi is currently provided for the below: UbuntuGIS pip3 Docker Conda FreeBSD Operating systems and build systems are managed on schedules and timelines that are driven by project requirements. As a result, various differences in dependencies and requirements arise. This is especially evident when adding features based on new packages that are available on some environments but not others. Given the above, it is critical that pygeoapi establish a dependency policy in order to manage development. Dependency policy Stable branch On a major or minor release, pygeoapi will implement a stable branch which is pinned to the dependencies at the time of release against master. In particular for a given dependency version such rules shall be met: the dependency must not have known high or critical vulnerabilities the Python dependency must have a corresponding operating system package for the supported Ubuntu version at the time As a result, stable branch shall only rely upon those libraries (and respective versions) which can be found on the above given OS baseline repositories. At the same time, the Docker image built with all the dependencies from stable branch must not have known high or critical vulnerabilities. master branch master branch dependencies and requirements shall be possibly consistent against a given operating system baseline: pip3 requirements Ubuntu dependencies (nice to have but not mandatory, see below for fixes) Docker / Docker Compose Fixes will be made and backported to stable branches as required. For security fixes, stable branch dependencies shall be updated as required. Adding/Removing (new) dependencies Careful consideration shall be given when new dependencies are proposed. New dependencies represent long term commitment and maintenance to dependency management and stability of pygeoapi. Any new dependency that does not have a corresponding Debian or Ubuntu package shall be fixed as soon as possible and the missing package made available via Ubuntu within 120 days (4 months) . If the dependency is not made available to the given distributions in the approved timeline, the developer who introduced the dependency is responsible for removing/reverting/replacing the dependency and the associated code in the codebase. The pygeoapi PSC reserves the right to remove/revert/replace the dependency and its associated code. Changes (Pull Requests) which add or remove dependencies shall be discussed and have a minimum of two approvals from the PSC .

As a result, various differences in dependencies and requirements arise. This is especially evident when adding features based on new packages that are available on some environments but not others.

Currently, the pygeoapi project lacks a standardized method for documenting architectural decisions. This lowers the ability of contributors, maintainers, and stakeholders to understand the reasoning behind certain design choices and may lead to misunderstandings or inefficiencies during the development process. At the moment architectural decisions are fragmented and hidden in the discussions of the issues/PRs themself. This RFC proposes the adoption of Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) as a best practice within the pygeoapi project. It serves as a starting point for discussing the feasibility and implications of adopting ADRs within the pygeoapi project. Feedback and contributions from the community are welcomed and encouraged to help shape the proposed implementation plan and ensure its successful adoption. Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) One approach gaining traction in the software development community is the use of Architectural Decision Records (ADRs). ADRs provide a structured way to capture important architectural decisions, their contexts, and the rationale behind them, thereby promoting transparency and aiding in future decision-making processes. They will be available as a markdown files under the documentation folder and eventually made published and searchable as web pages. An ADR may or may not be linked to a pull request but when there is a particular focus/impact on the design of the pygeoapi architecture then it can be required (if missing) as part of the review process to converge toward an architectural change with a documented and clear consensus/rejection. By adopting ADRs as a best practice, the pygeoapi project can enhance its architectural governance processes, foster collaboration among contributors, and ultimately deliver more robust and maintainable software solutions. By formally documenting key architectural decisions, we aim to achieve the following benefits: Transparency : ADRs provide transparency into the thought process behind architectural decisions, allowing contributors and stakeholders tounderstand the rationale and implications of various design choices. Consistency : A standardized format for documenting architectural decisions promotes consistency across the project, making it easier for new contributors to understand the project's architecture and guiding future decision-making processes. Knowledge Sharing : ADRs serve as a valuable knowledge-sharing tool, capturing the collective wisdom and experience of the project's contributors and enabling knowledge transfer across team members. Risk Mitigation : Documenting architectural decisions helps mitigate the risk of future misunderstandings or disputes by providing a clear record of the rationale behind each decision. Implementation Plan To adopt ADRs as a best practice within the pygeoapi project, the following steps are proposed. Education and Awareness Raise awareness among contributors, maintainers, and stakeholders about the benefits of ADRs and the proposed adoption process. Establishment of Guidelines Define clear guidelines for creating, maintaining, and organizing ADRs within the project repository. Integration with Development Workflow Integrate the creation and review of ADRs into the project's development workflow to ensure that important architectural decisions are documented in a timely manner. Documentation Update the project's documentation to include information on ADRs, their purpose, and how they should be used within the context of the pygeoapi project. Community Engagement Encourage community participation in the creation and review of ADRs to ensure that a diverse range of perspectives is considered in the decision-making process.

Currently, pygeoapi defines a server.limit configuration directive which corresponds to the limit query parameter as part of the OGC API - Features and OGC API - Records .../items endpoint. The following scenarios are missing from this setting: the ability for the server to provide a default limit when the user does not explicitly specify a limit the ability for the server to provide a maximum limit when the user specifies a limit that is deemed too large by the server to process given this setting is defined at the server level, it may not be suitable for all datasets in a given configuration limits currently only apply to vector data Proposed solution pygeoapi will define a limits configuration parameter that will allow a user to define default and maximum limits for multiple data types. This parameter will be defined at the server level ( server.limits ) with the ability to override at resource level ( resources[*].limits ). An example of this setting is shown below: limits: default_items: 20 # applies to vector data max_items: 500 # applies to vector data max_distance_x: 123 # applies to all datasets max_distance_y: 456 # applies to all datasets max_distance_units: m # as per UCUM https://ucum.org/ucum#section-Tables-of-Terminal-Symbols on_exceed: error # one of error, throttle The limits setting will be applied as follows: pygeoapi administrator is able to use at both the server and resources levels, with resources limits overriding server wide limits settings no limit specified by client: use limits.default_items to set the result set size limit specified by client: calculate the minimum of the query parameter and limits.max_items to set the result set size bbox or spatial dimensions: compare distance of request to maximum definition allowed in limits.max_distance_x and limits.max_distance_y Implementation an evaluate_limit function will be added to the pygeoapi module for use by pygeoapi.api accordingly if limits.on_exceed is error , then pygeoapi will throw HTTP 413 Backwards Compatibility Issues The limits setting fully replaces server.limit and represents a compatibility break. The new functionality will not be backported to other branches. Testing Tests will be added to ensure the expected functionality.
