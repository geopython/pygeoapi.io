# Service Providers

The pygeoapi Service Provivers page lists businesses, organizations and individuals around the world who can provide services related to pygeoapi.

In order to add your entity to the pygeoapi Service Providers page, you must be a clear, visible contributor to the project and community.

While listing new entities is welcome, the pygeoapi [Project Steering Committee (PSC)](https://pygeoapi.io/community/psc) reserves the right to update or remove organizations as required.

To add your entity:

- edit the page https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi.io/blob/master/docs/community/service-providers/index.md, by adding the below HTML div (following the last entry) as follows:

```html
  <div class="service-provider">
    <h2>My Entity</h2>
    <p>
      <span>Description of my Entity which can include HTML.</span>
    </p>
  </div>
```

- open a GitHub Pull Request of your addition, for review

If the Pull Request is merged, the page at https://pygeoapi.io/community/service-providers will be updated live.  Note that entities are randomly shuffled on each page load.
